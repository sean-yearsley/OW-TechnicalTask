# Technical Task (for OW)

# Prerequisites
Before attempting to start this app you will need to have installed:
- Visual Studios Code, or a similar editor
- Node.JS (as we will be using the npm command)

# How to start the app?
To run this app, simply follow these steps:
1. Open this repository using your editor
2. Open a new terminal
3. In the terminal we need to change the directory by running:
```console
cd react-app
```
4. Then run the following command in the terminal to install all the package dependencies:
```console
npm install
```
5. Finally we can run start the app:
```console
npm start
```

# Post task notes
There are a couple of things on my list that I would have liked to implement/improve had I not ran out of time:
- Adding a loading component that would have been set to display when the API was fetching data.
- Creating more unit tests. Specifically targetting the fetchApi, and the sorting functionality in the Table component.
